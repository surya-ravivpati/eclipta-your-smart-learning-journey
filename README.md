# Eclipta

> Learn. Compete. Progress.

Eclipta is a competitive learning platform where solving problems directly affects gameplay, progression, and strategy.

## What is Eclipta?

Eclipta is a gamified, AI-assisted learning platform where answering academic
questions powers real-time competitive **Knowledge Battles**, long-term
progression (Trophy Road, Ecliptars, daily streaks), collaborative **Study
Rooms**, a community forum and course system, and **Luna** — an AI tutor that
coaches *how to think* rather than handing over answers. It runs on React +
Supabase, with all AI behind serverless Edge Functions.

📄 **For a full, grounded product overview — vision, user journeys, features,
AI capabilities, educational philosophy, architecture, and current vs. planned
state — see [`PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`](./PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md).** It's written to
onboard a new collaborator (or another LLM) on the project in a few minutes.

> `supabase/migrations/` and Supabase Edge Functions under
> `supabase/functions/`). `PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` reflects the current state.

# Overview

Eclipta is built around a simple idea:

> learning should feel interactive, skill-based, and rewarding.

Instead of treating quizzes as something separate from gameplay, Eclipta turns knowledge into the gameplay itself.

In battles, answers directly affect:

* attacks
* combos
* momentum
* progression
* strategy

The project combines:

* strategy-game mechanics
* adaptive learning
* AI-assisted guidance
* progression and ranking systems
* social/community features
* animated modern UI design

At the center of the platform is **Knowledge Battles** — a real-time system where educational performance changes what players can actually do during combat.

The current codebase already includes:

* real-time battle systems
* AI-assisted learning flows
* progression/ranking systems
* adaptive educational experiences
* user profiles and progression tracking
* forum/community systems
* courses and learning paths
* animated UI systems

---

# Why This Project Exists

Most educational platforms follow the same pattern:

1. read content
2. answer questions
3. move forward

Eclipta experiments with a different approach:

> what if learning felt closer to a competitive game?

The goal is to make learning:

* interactive instead of passive
* skill-based instead of repetitive
* competitive without losing educational value
* rewarding beyond grades or completion percentages

# Features

Eclipta is a competitive learning platform built around the idea that knowledge should directly affect gameplay.

Instead of answering questions just to move forward, your performance changes what you can actually do inside battles, progression systems, and ranked experiences.

The project mixes:

* strategy-game mechanics
* adaptive learning
* AI-assisted guidance
* progression systems
* social/community features
* modern animated UI design

At the center of the platform is **Knowledge Battles** — a real-time system where solving problems powers attacks, momentum, combos, and strategic decisions.

Current systems in the repository include:

* Competitive knowledge-based battle systems
* AI-assisted learning flows
* Adaptive educational experiences
* Trophy/progression systems
* Social and community features
* User profiles and progression tracking
* Course and learning-path infrastructure
* Animated modern UI/UX systems

# Getting Started

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surya-ravivpati/eclipta-your-smart-learning-journey.git
cd eclipta-your-smart-learning-journey
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surya-ravivpati/eclipta-your-smart-learning-journey.git
cd eclipta-your-smart-learning-journey
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

If the repository does not already contain one, create a `.env.example` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

## 4. Configure Database / Supabase

Create a Supabase project and configure:

* Authentication providers
* Database schema
* Storage buckets (if applicable)
* Row-level security policies

> Note: No dedicated migration system or SQL migration directory was clearly present in the repository at the time of analysis. Database setup may currently be managed directly through Supabase.

## 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, the app should usually be available at:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

## Important Areas

### `KnowledgeBattles`

One of the core systems in the application.

Implements:

* Knowledge-driven combat
* Strategic gameplay mechanics
* Combo and momentum systems
* AI opponent logic
* Real-time progression interactions

### Routing

The application uses TanStack Router for:

* Nested routing
* Route-based layouts
* Authenticated flows
* Public/private page separation

# Backend / API

Eclipta does not currently include a standalone backend server.

Most backend functionality is handled through Supabase services and client-side integrations.

The project primarily functions as a frontend application integrated with Supabase services.

## Authentication

Authentication is managed through Supabase Auth.

Possible auth flows include:

* Email/password
* OAuth providers (if configured)
* Session-based authentication

## Backend Services

The frontend communicates with:

* Supabase database
* Supabase authentication APIs
* Supabase storage APIs

> No standalone REST or Express API server was identified in the repository during analysis.

---

# Development

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make isolated changes
3. Run linting and type checks
4. Test affected functionality
5. Open a pull request

## Local Development Tips

### Use TypeScript Strictly

Prefer explicit typing for:

* Battle systems
* Game state logic
* API responses
* Route data

### Keep Components Modular

Some gameplay systems are currently large and complex.

As the project grows, consider splitting large gameplay components into:

* Engine/state logic
* Rendering layers
* Animation systems
* Matchmaking systems
* AI systems

#### Things That Would Improve the Project Long-Term

* automated testing
* proper database migrations
* CI/CD workflows
* replay/spectator systems
* better separation of gameplay logic from UI

---

## Branching

Suggested branching strategy:

```txt
main
 ├── feature/*
 ├── fix/*
 └── experimental/*
```


## Reporting Issues

When opening issues, include:

* Environment details
* Reproduction steps
* Expected behavior
* Screenshots/logs if applicable

---

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Environment Variables Missing

If you see Supabase connection errors:

```txt
Missing Supabase environment variables
```

Ensure your `.env` file contains:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

### Port Already In Use

If Vite fails to start:

```bash
lsof -i :5173
```

Then stop the conflicting process or change the Vite port.

### Dependency Installation Problems

Try deleting:

```txt
node_modules/
package-lock.json
```

Then reinstall:

```bash
npm install
```

* progression is skill-based
* learning becomes interactive instead of passive

The project currently uses:

* React 19
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Supabase
* Tailwind CSS
