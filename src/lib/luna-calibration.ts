/**
 * Luna calibration engine — pure, framework-free.
 *
 * A short diagnostic that measures the dimensions that actually predict good
 * tutoring (NOT the debunked "learning styles" myth): prior ability, working-
 * memory / chunk tolerance, pace, struggle response, *scaffold response*, and
 * metacognitive accuracy (confidence vs. correctness). See
 * docs/luna-learner-model.md for the rationale.
 *
 * What makes this distinct: the scaffold items teach a *made-up* rule two ways
 * (worked-example-first vs. discover-the-pattern), then test transfer — so we
 * measure how a person LEARNS something new, not what they already know. And
 * we capture a pre-answer confidence on every item, so Luna can tell whether a
 * learner knows what they know and correct over/under-confidence.
 *
 * This module has no UI and no I/O. It produces a LearningProfile from the
 * recorded responses; persistence + rendering live elsewhere.
